//Designed to see if you can draw things.

//Create and draw three different 2D objects.
//Examples are star, points (at least 1500), square, triangle, trapezoid, lines (at least 6), any kind of polygon, and etc. Stick with 2D.
//Use mouse controls: left click cycles through drawing the different objects and right click to exit the program.

//Use different GLenum modes aka OpenGL primitives along with GL_QUADS and etc.
